Title: **Vector Space**

A vector space is a non-empty set $V$ of elements we call vectors which satisfy
$$\mu\underline{u} + \lambda\underline{v} \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \text{if}\ \ \  \underline{u}, \underline{v} \in V, \ \ \ \ \  \mu, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$$
where $\underline{u}, \underline{v} \in V$ are vectors and $\lambda , \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ are scalars and $\mathbb{R}$ is a **scalar field.** 
```

Therefore we can abstract the notion of $a-b$ as we have:
$$\underline{u} - \underline{v} = \underline{u} + (-1)\underline{v} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (\mu = 1, \lambda = -1)$$
We are missing an abstraction for the [[Vectors as displacement#^c5b273|absolute value]] $\mid \cdot \mid$. The vector space version of the absolute value is called the [[Norm in a Vector Space|norm]].
