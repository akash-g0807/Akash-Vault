Title: **Gravitational Force**

The gravitational force between 2 particles of *mass* $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, situated at $\underline{r_{1}}$ and $\underline{r_{2}}$ (i.e. the force felt by particle 1 because of the prescence of particle 2) is given by
$$\underline{F_{12}} = \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{\mid r_{1} - r_{2} \mid^{2}} \ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid}$$
$$\underline{F_{21}} = \frac{Gm_{2}m_{1}}{\mid r_{2} - r_{1} \mid^{2}} \ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid}$$
where the two forces are **equal** and **opposite in direction**:  $\underline{F_{12}} = -\underline{F_{21}}$
```



***Note:*** The vectors:
$$\ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid} \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \  \frac{\underline{r_{2}} - \underline{r_{1}}}{\mid \underline{r_{2}} - \underline{r_{1}} \mid}$$
are [[Unit Vector|unit vectors]]. That is they give the *direction* of the gravitational force, and it is in the **direction directed towards each other**. 

### Gravitational Constant

G is the **gravitational constant**. It has [[Dimensional Analysis|dimensions]]:
$$[G] = \frac{L^{3}}{MT^2}$$
and approximately has the value
>[!info]+ Gravitational Constant 
>$$G \approx 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \ \ m^3/kg\ s^{2}$$

Title: **Gravitational Force Near Earth**

The **gravitational force** felt by a particle (mass $m$) *near* the surface of the earth is given approximately by
$$\underline{F} = -mg\underline{k}$$
where 
$$g = \frac{Gm_{\text{earth}}}{R^{2}_{\text{earth}}} \approx 9.8 m/s^{2}$$
```

Hence *near* the, [[Newton's Equation of Motion]] becomes:
$$\begin{aligned} m\underline{\ddot{r}} = -mg\underline{k} &\Rightarrow \underline{\ddot{r}} = -mg\underline{k} \end{aligned}$$
i.e gravitational acceleration **independent of the mass**.
