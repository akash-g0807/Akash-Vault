In this section, we will deal with ideal **particles**. Particles are an idealization since real objects even if  very small have very small a spatial extent. **Particles** will be represented by a **point in space** that movies in a trajectory denoted by $\underline{r}(t)$ which is a vector denoting its position at a time t *relative* to a specified origin.
