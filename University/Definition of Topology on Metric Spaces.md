# Definition of Topology on Metric Spaces $\boldsymbol{(X,d)}$
---
```ad-Definition

Tile: **Topology space on $(X,d)$**

So the topology of a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]] $T_d$ is the **collection of all [[Open and Closed Sets|open subsets]]** of $X,d$ 
```

>[!note]
>$$T_{d}\subseteq \mathbb{P}(x)$$
>where $\mathbb{P}$ is the **[[Power Set]]**

## Further Notes
---
We have defined the **topology** on [[Open and Closed Sets|open sets]], but we can also try and definite for [[Open and Closed Sets#^5a4f54|closed sets]].
- [[Collections of Closed Sets]]
