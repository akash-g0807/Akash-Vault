# Topology on Metric Spaces $\boldsymbol{(X,d)}$

```ad-Definition

Tile: **Topology space on $(X,d)$**

So the topology of a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]] $T_d$ is the **collection of all [[Open and Closed Sets|open subsets]]** of $X,d$ 
```

>[!note]
>$$T_{d}\subseteq \mathbb{P}(x)$$
>where $\mathbb{P}$ is the **[[Power Set]]**
