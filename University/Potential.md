Some forces have a very special property that they can be written as:
$$\underline{F} = - \underline{\nabla} \Phi$$
where $\nabla$ is the [[Gradient Operator]]. Therefore we can define the following:

Title: **Force in a potential**

Some forces are the [[Gradient Operator|gradient]] of a potential:
$$\underline{F} = - \underline{\nabla}\Phi = - \Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \underline{i} + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \underline{j} + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \underline{k}\Big)\Phi = - \Big(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} \underline{i} + \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y} \underline{j} + \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} \underline{k}\Big)$$
or using [[Einstein's Notation]] 
$$\underline{F} = \underline{\nabla}\Phi = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x_{a}}\underline{e_{a}}$$
```

*Note*: Such forces are known as **conservative forces**
