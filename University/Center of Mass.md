Title: **Center of Mass**

In a discrete system with $N$ particles with mass $m_{i}$ and with position $\underline{r_{i}}(t)$ relative to a chosen origin $O$, the center of mass is defined as a [[General Definition of Vectors|vector]]:

$$\underline{R} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}m_{i}\underline{r_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}m_{i}}$$
```

*Note*: The denominator is the **total mass** and we denoted it by:
$$M = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}m_{i}$$
And hence
$$\underline{R} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}m_{i}\underline{r_{i}}}{M}$$
> [!note]+ Total External Force using Center of Mass
> The [[Total Force in a Collection of Particles|Total Force]] then will be
> $$M\underline{\ddot{R}} = \underline{F^{(e)}_\text{total}}$$

*Note*:
If the sum of **external forces is** $0$, i.e. $\underline{F}^{(e)}_{\text{total}} = 0$, then $\underline{\ddot{R}} = 0$, and therefore $\underline{\dot{R}}$ is **constant** and hence center of mass *moves* with **constant velocity**
