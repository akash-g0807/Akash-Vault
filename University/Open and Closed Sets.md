# Open and Closed Sets
---
Let $(X,d)$ be a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]]. 

### Open Sets
---
```ad-Definition

Title: **Open Sets**

A subset $A$ of $X$, $A \subset X$  is **open**
$$\iff$$
$$A \cap \partial A = \emptyset$$
where $\partial A$ is the [[Interior and Exterior and Boundary Points|boundary]] of $A$
```

### Closed Sets

```ad-Definition

Title: **Closed Set**

A subset $A$ of $X$, $A \subset X$ is **closed**
$$\iff$$
$$\partial F \subseteq F$$
where $\partial A$ is the [[Interior and Exterior and Boundary Points|boundary]] of $A$

TItle: **Clopen Sets**

A set that is *BOTH* **open AND closed** is called a **clopen** set.
