Title: **Open ball**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]]. Then for any $x \in X$ and for any $r \in (0, \infty)$, the **OPEN BALL** **centered at $X$** and of radius $r$ *denoted* by $B(x,r)$ is the set
$$B(x,r) = \{y \in X : d(y,x) < r\}$$

Title: **Closed Ball**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]] and and $x \in X$, and $r \in (0, \infty)$. The **CLOSED BALL** **centered at $X$** of radius $r$ *denoted* by $\bar{B}(x,r)$ as the set
$$\bar{B}(x,r) = \{y \in X : d(y,x) \leq r\}$$
