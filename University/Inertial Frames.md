# Inertial Frames
---
The laws of physics are the ***SAME*** in ***ALL*** **inertial frames**. Inertial frames are frames where [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's law of inertia]] holds. 

We need to know how to *convert* [[Position of a particle|position]], [[Kinematics-Velocity and Acceleration|velocity and acceleration]] from one frame of reference to another. Therefore consider the following diagram:
