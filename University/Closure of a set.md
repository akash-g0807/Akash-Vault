# Closure of a set

### Definition of Closure
---
```ad-Definition

Title: **Closure**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[General Definition of Metric Spaces|metric space]] and $A \subseteq X$. 
The **closure** of $A$ *denoted by* 
$$\bar{A}$$
is defined to be
$$\bar{A} = A \cup \partial A$$
where $\partial A$  is the set of [[Interior and Exterior and Boundary Points|boundary points]].
```

*Note:* Set $A$ may be open or closed or both
*Note*: $A \subseteq \bar{A}$, i.e. $\bar{A}$ is a **superset**
