Title: **Inverse Square Law**

If a particle is moving under the influence of **inverse square law** force directed towards the origin:
$$\underline{F} = -\frac{\alpha}{\mid \underline{r} \mid^{2}} \ \frac{\underline{r}}{\mid\underline{r}\mid}$$
where $\alpha$ is a positive constant. And then we note:
$$\underline{F} = \underline{\nabla}\Bigg(\frac{a}{\mid \underline{r}\mid}\Bigg) = -\underline{\nabla}\Phi \ \ \  \Rightarrow\ \ \ \Phi = \frac{a}{\mid \underline{r}\mid}$$
```

*Note*: Total [[Potential and Conservation|Energy]] is conserved, i.e. it is constant:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}m\mid\underline{v}\mid^{2} - \frac{\alpha}{\mid\underline{r}\mid} = \text{CONSTANT}$$
### Properties of Inverse Square Law
---
We can derive the following properties

- If $E \geq 0$, then the particle can escape to infinity but cannot come to close to the origin $\underline{r} = 0$
- If $E < 0$, then the particle cannot escape to infinity nor can its orbit approach too close to $0$.
