# Newton's Equation of Motion

In an [[Inertial Frames|inertial frame]], a particle moves in such a way that its [[Kinematics-Velocity and Acceleration|acceleration]] is **proportional** to the sum of all forces acting on it ([[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]), i.e. 
```ad-Definition
Title: **Equation of Motion**
$$\underline{F} = m\underline{a} = m\frac{d^{2}\underline{r}}{dt^{2}} \equiv m\underline{\ddot{r}}$$
```

More generally, we can define it as
$$\underline{F} = \frac{d\underline{p}}{dt}$$where $\underline{p}$ is [[momentum]] and 
$$\underline{p} = m\underline{v} = m\dot{\underline{r}}$$
***Note:*** if the forces acting on the particle sum to zero, meaning $\underline{F} = 0$, then the **equation of motion** can be integrated directly to give the trajectory
$$\underline{r} = \underline{r}_{0} + t\underline{v}_{0}$$
In other words, the particle moves in a straight line at a constant velocity ([[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's First Law of Motion]]).
