# Newton's Laws of Motion

```ad-Definition
Title: **Newton's Law of Inertia**
 Any body which **isn**’t being acted on by an **outside force** stays at rest if it is *initially* at rest, or continues to move at a **constant** velocity if that’s what it was doing to begin with. i.e.
 
Every object will *remain* at **rest** or in **uniform motion** in a **straight line** unless *compelled* to change its state by the action of an **external force.**
