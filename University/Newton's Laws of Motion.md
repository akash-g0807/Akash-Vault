# Newton's Laws of Motion

### Inertia
```ad-Definition
Title: **Newton's Law of Inertia**
 Any body which **isn**’t being acted on by an **outside force** stays at rest if it is *initially* at rest, or continues to move at a **constant** velocity if that’s what it was doing to begin with. i.e.
 
Every object will *remain* at **rest** or in **uniform motion** in a **straight line** unless *compelled* to change its state by the action of an **external force.**
```

### Newton's First Law
---
```ad-Definition

Title: **Newton's First Law**

Every body **continues** in a state of *rest* or *uniform motion* in a right line unless t is compelled to change that state by **forces** impressed on it. 
```

### Newton's Second Law
---
```ad-Definition
Title: Newton's Second Law:

The *change* of motion is **proportional** to the **motive force** impressed on it and is *made* in the **direction of the right line** in which that force was impressed.
```

Newton's second law postulates a *relation* between [[Kinematics-Velocity and Acceleration|acceration]] of the body and the forces acting on it.  Therefore we can reformulate Newon's second law as follows:

```ad-Definition
The **net force** $\underline{F}$ on a body of **constant mass** causes a body to **accelerate**. The acceleration $\underline{\ddot{r}}$ is *in the direction* of $\underline{F}$ **proportional** to the magnitude of the force and **inversely proportional**  to the mass of the body:
$$\ddot{\underline{x}} = \frac{\underline{F}}{m}$$
or equivantly
$$\underline{F} = m\underline{\ddot{x}}$$
```

### Newton's Third Law

```ad-Definition

TItle: **Newton's Third Law**

**To every action, there is an opposed and equal reaction**; or the mutual action of two bodies upon two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts
