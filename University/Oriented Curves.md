### Orientation

```ad-Definition

Title: **Orientation**

An orientation of a curve $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a choice of direction along $C$. 
```

There are always **2 possible orientations of a curve**. Usually this means a choice of which is end is the beginning and which is the end. 
From now on, whenever a curve is talked about, it will have a chosen orientation.

Title: **Oriented Curve**

An **oriented** curve $C$ is an [[Parametric Curves as Equivalence Relations|equivalence class of parametric curves]] where 2 parametric curves are **equivalent** if they are [[Parametric Curves|reparametrizations]] of each other.
```

*Remark*: Less precisely you can think of curves as a subset $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. A parametric curve $\underline{p}: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a **parameterization of a curve** C if it is the **image** of $\underline{p}$, i.e.
$$C = \{\underline{p}(t) \mid a \leq t \leq b\}$$
and as $t$ increases, $\underline{p}(t)$ movies in the direction of the orientation of $C$. ^a5558f
