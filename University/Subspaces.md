Title: **Subspaces**

Let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,d^{'})$ be [[General Definition of Metric Spaces#^eb87d4|metric spaces]]. We say that $(Y,d^{'})$ is a **subspace**
of $(X,d)$ if:
1. $Y \subseteq X$;
2. $d^{'} = d \mid Y \times Y$ 

So all axioms of metrix spaces hold in $Y$ and
$$(Y, d^{'})$$
is a metric space
```

*Note*: 
1. $d^{'} = d \mid Y \times Y$ means that the distance function $d^{'}$ is **restricted** to the set $Y \times Y$ and can also be denoted $d\mid_{Y}$.
2. We call $X$ the **ambient space**.
3. **REMEMBER:** Subset DOES NOT MEAN subspace.
