Title: **Line Integral**

The **line integral** of a [[Scalar and Vector Fields|vector field]] $\underline{g} : \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ a curve $C$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a number *denoted by*
$$\int_{C}\underline{g}(\underline{x})\cdot d\underline{x}$$
```

*Note:* The **dot** in the integral between vector field $\underline{g}$ and $d\underline{x}$ **is a [[Scalar Product]]**

#### Example of Line Integral
---
> [!math|{"type":"example","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"_index":0}] Example 1.
> Suppose that an object moves through space along a curve $C$, while acted on a **force** $\underline{F}$, that depends on position, but not on time.
> 
> The **amount of energy** transferred to the object by the force is called **[[Work Done|work]]**. This is the line integral
> $$W = \int_{C}\underline{F}(\underline{x})\cdot d\underline{x}$$
