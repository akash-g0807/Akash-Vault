# Examples of Boundedness
---

1. Consider the following set:
$$S_{1} = \{x \in \mathbb{K}: a <x < b \} = (0, 1)$$
	- Here $S_1$ is bounded below with a lower bound of $a$ (or anything less than $a$). 
	- Here $S_1$ is bounded above with an upper bound of $b$ or (anything bigger than $b$). 

2. Consider the another set:
$$S_{2} = \{x \in \mathbb{K}: a < x\} = (0,\infty)$$
	- Is bounded below with a lower bound of $a$ (or anything smaller than $a$). 
	- $S_2$ is **not** bounded above. 

3. Consider another example
$$S_{3}= \{x \in \mathbb{K}: x< b\}$$
	- $S_3$ is bounded above with an upper bound of $b$ (or anything bigger than $b$). 
	- $S_3$ is not bounded below.

4. $\mathbb{K}$ itself is **neither bounded above nor below*
