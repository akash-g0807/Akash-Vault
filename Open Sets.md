```ad-Definition
Title: **Open Sets**

A subset $\mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is **open** if for any $\underline{x} \in \mathcal{U}$, there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that for any point at a distance less than $\delta$ from $\underline{x}$ is also in $\mathcal{U}$ 
```

- Basically saying for that for any point $\underline{x} \in \mathcal{U}$, you can make a **disk/sphere with radius** **$\delta$**  in $\mathcal{U}$ such that any point that is at a distance within $\delta$ is in the subset $\mathcal{U}$.

- Note that under this definition, the subset $\mathcal{U}$ **cannot contain** the  **endpoints** as illustrated by the following diagram.
