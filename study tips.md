1. Always aim for 100%. Worst case: you'll do well. 
2. Write everything down from the lecture and know your notes by heart. 
3. Do all the homework. 
4. Be able to redo all your homework without looking at your notes. 
5. Be on top of everything, finish everything as soon as possible. 
6. Aim to be number one / top of the class at all times. 
7. Study the example questions / old exams for the test. 
8. My own tip: Understand the hardest examples from the books, the tests are usually easier.
