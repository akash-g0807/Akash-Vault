# Boundedness of Sets
---
We define the properties of a set $S$ being **bounded above**, **bounded below**, and **bounded**.

```ad-Definition
Title: **Bounded Above and Upperbound**

A subset $S$ of an ordered [[field]] $\mathbb{K}$ is said to be **bounded above** if there is a constant $b \in \mathbb{K}$ such that $x \leq b$ **for all** $x \in S$. 

Such a constant is called an **upperbound** for $S$
```

```ad-Definition
Title: **Bounded Below and Lowerbound**

A subset $S$ of an ordered [[field]] $\mathbb{K}$ is said to be **bounded below** if there is a constant $a \in \mathbb{K}$ such that $x \geq a$ **for all** $x \in S$. 

Such a constant is called a **lowerbound** for $S$
```

Using the above two definition, we can make a definition of what it means for a **set to be bounded**.

```ad-Definition
Title: **Boundeded**

A subset $S$ of an ordered [[field]] $\mathbb{K}$ is said to be **bounded** if it is bounded **both** above and below.

That is *there exists* both $a$ and $b$ such that $a \leq x \leq b$ *for all* $x \in S$
```

- *Note:* **Upperbounds** and **Lowerbounds** are **NOT UNIQUE**. Once you have one, you have lots.
	- If you have an upperbound $b$, anything bigger than $b$ is also an upperbound.
	- If you have a lowerbound $a$, anything snaller than $a$ is also a lowerbound.
