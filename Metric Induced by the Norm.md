# Metric Induced by the norm
---

We call the vector space with a [[Norm in a Vector Space|norm]] a **normed space**, and all normed spaces have a natural metric called **metric induced by the norm** and 
$$d: V \times V \rightarrow [0,\infty):\  \mid\mid \underline{u} - \underline{v} \mid\mid = \mid\mid\underline{u} + (-1)\underline{v} \mid\mid$$
