# Vector Product
---
This is also known as **cross product**. Vector product is a function *denoted* by "$\times$" . 

- **Motivation for cross product:** Given 2 non-zero vectors $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ construct a new vector say $\underline{v}$ that is **orthogonal** to  *both* $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$. 

```ad-Definition
Title: **Cross Product**

The cross product between 2 **3 dimensional** vectors $\underline{u}$ and \underline{v} is a vector with length:

$$\mid \underline{u} \times \underline{v} \mid \space = \space \mid \underline{u} \mid \cdot \mid \underline{v} \mid \sin\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the [[Scalar Product|planar angle]] between $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ and in **direction orthogonal** to both $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ 
```

### Right hand Rule

We can *determine* the **direction** of vector $\underline{u} \times \underline{v}$ using the **right hand rule**. It is illustrated in the following diagram:
