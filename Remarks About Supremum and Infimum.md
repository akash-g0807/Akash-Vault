# Remarks about Supremum and Infimum
---

1. The supremum $S$ is by definition, the **minimum of  upperbounds.** i.e. Let $B$ be the **set of all upperbounds of** $S$. Then:
$$\sup(S) = \min(B)$$
	Therefore since the $\sup(S)$ is the minimum of a set, it is **unique**.

2. If a **set has a maximum** $\max(S)$ then, 
$$\max(S) = \sup(S)$$
To see this, let $b = \max(s)$. So $b \in S$ and $b$ is an upperbound. **Any other $b^{'} < b$ is not an upperbound.** Therefore **$b = sup(S)$** 

4. Similarly, of a set has a minimum $\min(S)$, then,
$$\min(S) = \sup(S)$$
