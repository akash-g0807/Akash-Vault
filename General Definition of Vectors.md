```ad-Definition
Title: **$N$-dimensional vector**
An *n-dimensional* vectors is an element of
$$\mathbb{R}^{n}= \{(x_{1},\ldots, x_{n}) \mid x_{1}, \ldots x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}\}$$
The numbers $x_a$ for $a = 1, \ldots , n$ are **coordinates** or **components** of the vector
```

It is extremely convenient to use the abbreviated "*vector notation*": 
$$\underline{x} = (x_{1},\ldots x_{n})$$

It will also be useful to think of an *n-dimensional* vector as an **$\boldsymbol{ n \times 1}$ matrix** 
$$
\begin{equation*}
\underline{x} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{1{}} \\
\vdots \\ 
x_n \\ 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
